- see the homepage that offers basically what the app offers.
    - the title, featured memes, and buttons to:
- signup for and account/ create an account, so that I can log in.
    - have my details saved so that I can:

    - a user model with password and email/username.
    - a user controller.
    - a post route in the user's controller that can save the user.
    -
- see memes, save memes, choose favorite memes from a list of memes.
